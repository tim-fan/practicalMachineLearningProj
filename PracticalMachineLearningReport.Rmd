## Executive Summary
To Do

## Exploratory Analysis

Fetch the training and test data:

```{r download}
trainingDataUrl = 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv'
testDataUrl = 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv'

trainingDataFilename = 'data/pml-training.csv'
testDataFileneme = 'data/pml-testing.csv'

dir.create('data', showWarnings = FALSE)
download.file(trainingDataUrl, destfile = trainingDataFilename)
download.file(testDataUrl, destfile = testDataFileneme)

trainingData <- read.csv(trainingDataFilename)
```

```{r explore}
names(trainingData)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
